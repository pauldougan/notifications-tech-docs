# REST API documentation

This documentation is for developers interested in using the GOV.UK Notify API to send emails, text messages or letters.

You can use it to integrate directly with the API if you cannot use one of our 6 client libraries.

## Base URL
```
https://api.notifications.service.gov.uk
```

## Headers

### Authorisation header

The authorisation header is an API key that is encoded using JSON Web Tokens. You must include an authorisation header.

Refer to the:

- [JSON Web Tokens website](https://jwt.io/) for more information on encoding your authorisation header
- [API keys](#api-keys) section of this documentation for more information on API key type

JSON Web Tokens have a standard header:

```
{
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "HS256"
}
```

JSON Web Tokens have a payload that consists of:

```JSON
{
  "iss": "api key",
  "iat": 1568818578
}
```
where `iat` (issued at) is the current time in UTC in epoch seconds. The token expires within 30 seconds of the current time.

```JSON
"Authorization": "Bearer encoded_api_key"
```

### Content header

The content header is `application/json`:

```JSON
"Content-type": "application/json"
```

# Send a message

You can use GOV.UK Notify to send text messages, emails and letters.

## Send a text message

```
POST /v2/notifications/sms
```

### Request body

 ```JSON
    {
      "phone_number": "+447900900123",
      "template_id": "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a"
    }
 ```

### Arguments

#### phone_number (required)

The phone number of the recipient of the text message. This can be a UK or international number.

#### template_id (required)

Sign in to [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) and go to the __Templates__ page to find the template ID.

#### personalisation (optional)

If a template has placeholder fields for personalised information such as name or reference number, you must provide their values in a dictionary with key value pairs. For example:

```json
  "personalisation": {
    "first_name": "Amala",
    "application_date": "2018-01-01",
  }
```

You can leave out this argument if a template does not have any placeholder fields for personalised information.

#### reference (optional)

An identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```json
"reference": "STRING"
```

You can leave out this argument if you do not have a reference.

#### sms_sender_id (optional)

A unique identifier of the sender of the text message notification. You can find this information on the __Text Message sender__ settings screen:

1. Sign into your GOV.UK Notify account.
1. Go to __Settings__.
1. If you need to change to another service, select __Switch service__ in the top right corner of the screen and select the correct one.
1. Go to the __Text Messages__ section and select __Manage__ on the __Text Message sender__ row.

You can then either:

- copy the sender ID that you want to use and paste it into the method
- select __Change__ to change the default sender that the service will use, and select __Save__

```JSON
"sms_sender_id": "8e222534-7f05-4972-86e3-17c5d9f894e2"
```

You can leave out this argument if your service only has one text message sender, or if you want to use the default sender.

### Response

If the request is successful, the response body is `json` with a status code of `201`:

```JSON
{
  "id": "740e5834-3a29-46b4-9a6f-16142fde533a",
  "reference": "STRING",
  "content": {
    "body": "MESSAGE TEXT",
    "from_number": "SENDER"

  }
}
```

If you are using the [test API key](#test), all your messages will come back with a `delivered` status.

All messages sent using the [team and whitelist](#team-and-whitelist) or [live](#live) keys will appear on your dashboard.

## Send a file by email

Send files without the need for email attachments.

This is an invitation-only feature. [Contact the GOV.UK Notify team](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support/ask-question-give-feedback) to enable this function for your service.

To send a file by email, add a placeholder field to the template then upload a file. The placeholder field will contain a secure link to download the file.

#### Add a placeholder field to the template

1. Sign in to [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant email template.
1. Add a placeholder field to the email template using double brackets. For example:

"Download your file at: ((link_to_document))"

#### Upload your file

The file you upload must be a PDF file smaller than 2MB. Youâ€™ll need to convert the file into a string that is base64 encoded.

Pass the file object as a value into the personalisation argument. For example:

```JSON
"personalisation":{
      "first_name": "Amala",
      "application_date": "2018-01-01",
      "link_to_document": "file as base64 encoded string",

# Get message status

Message status depends on the type of message you have sent.

You can only get the status of messages that are 7 days old or newer.

## Status - text and email

|Status|Information|
|:---|:---|
|Created|GOV.UK Notify has placed the message in a queue, ready to be sent to the provider. It should only remain in this state for a few seconds.|
|Sending|GOV.UK Notify has sent the message to the provider. The provider will try to deliver the message to the recipient. GOV.UK Notify is waiting for delivery information.|
|Delivered|The message was successfully delivered.|
|Failed|This covers all failure statuses:<br>- `permanent-failure` - "The provider could not deliver the message because the email address or phone number was wrong. You should remove these email addresses or phone numbers from your database. Youâ€™ll still be charged for text messages to numbers that do not exist."<br>- `temporary-failure` - "The provider could not deliver the message after trying for 72 hours. This can happen when the recipient's inbox is full or their phone is off. You can try to send the message again. Youâ€™ll still be charged for text messages to phones that are not accepting messages."<br>- `technical-failure` - "Your message was not sent because there was a problem between Notify and the provider.<br>Youâ€™ll have to try sending your messages again. You will not be charged for text messages that are affected by a technical failure."|

## Status - text only

|Status|Information|
|:---|:---|
|Pending|GOV.UK Notify is waiting for more delivery information.<br>GOV.UK Notify received a callback from the provider but the recipientâ€™s device has not yet responded. Another callback from the provider determines the final status of the notification.|
|Sent / Sent internationally|The message was sent to an international number. The mobile networks in some countries do not provide any more delivery information. The GOV.UK Notify client API returns this status as `sent`. The GOV.UK Notify client app returns this status as `Sent internationally`.|

## Status - letter

|Status|information|
|:---|:---|
|Failed|The only failure status that applies to letters is `technical-failure`. GOV.UK Notify had an unexpected error while sending to our printing provider.|
|Accepted|GOV.UK Notify has sent the letter to the provider to be printed.|
|Received|The provider has printed and dispatched the letter.|

## Status - precompiled letter

|Status|information|
|:---|:---|
|Pending virus check|GOV.UK Notify has not completed a virus scan of the precompiled letter file.|
|Virus scan failed|GOV.UK Notify found a potential virus in the precompiled letter file.|
|Validation failed|Content in the precompiled letter file is outside the printable area. See the [GOV.UK Notify PDF letter specification](https://docs.notifications.service.gov.uk/documentation/images/notify-pdf-letter-spec-v2.3.pdf) for more information.|
